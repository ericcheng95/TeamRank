How to Set Up:
Create (or Modify if already existing) a file in the Teams folder called Teams
It should be at the file path Teams/Teams
Name every team that is playing in this tournament, one per line

For each Round you play, create a new file and put it in the Rounds folder
Rounds should follow syntax Round00, Round01, ... etc. (start at 00)
Format for each match should be as follows:
[Team 1 Name]:[Team 2 Name]:[Team 1 Score]:[Team 2 Score]
Make sure you do not misspell anything

To run ranking algorithm:
python teamrank.py ranking [firstRound] [lastRound] [Optional: roundToPredict]

e.g. This will rank the first 4 rounds
python teamrank.py ranking 0 3

e.g. This will do the same as above ^
python teamrank.py ranking 0 3 4
You can change the roundToPredict to an older round to see how accurate the predictions are

To run prediction algorithm:
Create the Round file for the upcoming match and fill it up with the team names
(don't include score)
e.g.
[Team 1 Name]:[Team 2 Name]:

python teamrank.py prediction [firstRound] [previouslyPlayedRound]

e.g. This will create prediction for the 4th round (Round03)
python teamrank.py prediction 0 2

If the predicted round already has a score, the output will printed alongside
the prediction.
